The difference between addEventListener and onclick mainly lies in how they handle events in JavaScript.

onclick:
It's a property of DOM elements.
You can assign a function to it. If you assign a new function, it replaces the old one.

addEventListener:
It is a method that can be used to attach multiple event handlers to an element.
You can add several functions for the same event without replacing the previous ones.
You can also specify the event phase (capture/bubble)

Using addEventListener is often preferred because it provides more flexibility in managing events. For more details, you can check MDN Web Docs on addEventListener
